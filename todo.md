All below **must** be ECS driven in creation and mutation. This is THE design goal of this engine,
to abstract everything via ECS, eventually even abstracting internal engine-level stuff like resources, windows, input etc.
* 3D Primitives
    * Cubes
    * Spheres
    * Cylinders
    * Capsules
    * Lines
* Textures
* Shaders
* Camera/viewport
* Screen clear
* Skybox
* Input
* Meshes

prints on-screen.
